# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Claude Conversation Exporter - a browser-based JavaScript utility that exports Claude AI conversations to Markdown and JSON formats. The project consists of a single JavaScript file that runs entirely in the user's browser console without any dependencies or build process.

## Key Architecture

The script (`claude_export_script.js`) performs the following operations:

1. **ID Extraction**: Uses multiple methods to extract organization ID from localStorage, sessionStorage, global variables, cookies, and DOM
2. **API Integration**: Fetches conversation data from Claude's internal API endpoint
3. **Data Processing**: Converts JSON responses to formatted Markdown, handling:
   - Regular messages and thinking sections
   - Tool usage and results
   - File attachments and artifacts
   - Truncated content indicators
4. **File Generation**: Creates downloadable .md and .json files locally in the browser

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Pure vanilla JavaScript - no frameworks or dependencies
- Browser console execution environment
- No build process or transpilation needed
- UUID format validation for organization and conversation IDs

### Testing Approach
- Manual testing in browser console
- Test with various conversation types (with/without thinking, tool use, attachments)
- Verify organization ID extraction works across different Claude UI states
- Check file downloads work in major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### Common Tasks

To test the script:
1. Open any Claude conversation in your browser
2. Open developer console (F12)
3. Paste the entire `claude_export_script.js` content
4. Press Enter to execute
5. Verify two files download: `claude_conversation.md` and `claude_conversation.json`

### Security Considerations
- Script runs entirely client-side with no external data transmission
- Uses browser's existing authentication (cookies/session)
- Validates UUID formats before API calls
- Handles API errors gracefully with console logging

## üìù CRITICAL: Detailed Commit Message Requirements

### MANDATORY: Comprehensive Commit Documentation
Every commit MUST include detailed technical documentation to prevent recurring issues and regressions.

#### Commit Message Structure (REQUIRED):
```
fix/feat/chore: Brief summary of the change

## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (REQUIRED for fixes)
### The Problem:
- Detailed description of the exact issue
- Technical root cause explanation
- Why this occurred (environmental factors, configuration, etc.)

### Impact:
- What was broken or not working
- User experience impact
- System behavior before fix

## üõ†Ô∏è SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED (REQUIRED)
### Technical Changes:
- Specific code changes made
- Configuration modifications
- Before/after comparisons with code examples

### Why This Works:
- Technical explanation of the solution
- How it addresses the root cause
- Integration with existing systems

## üö® PREVENTION MEASURES (REQUIRED for recurring issues)
### To Prevent Future Regression:

- Testing requirements

### Code Patterns to Remember:
```typescript
// Example of correct pattern
const config = {
  setting: false, // CRITICAL: Must be false
  // ... explanation
};
```

## üîó RELATED ISSUES/COMMITS (REQUIRED if applicable)
- Previous fixes for same issue
